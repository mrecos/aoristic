## aoristic weighting for archaeology
This is a repo to house my R code on implimenting a version of aoristic functions for archaeology data.  This is not a package at this time, just a place to work from.  For a fully functioning package to d aoristic weighting in archaeology, see David Corton's GH repo and R package: <https://github.com/davidcorton/archSeries> 

### ToDo:

*  Add parallel and optimize code to speed it up
*  port probabilistic portions to Stan model
*  Incorporate spatial objects
